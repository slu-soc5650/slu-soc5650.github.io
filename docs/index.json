The goal is to get more comfortable talking and thinking about maps, their purpose, and you need to make them.\n Map 1 - Yosemite Valley Detail Map via the National Park Service / npmaps.com Map 2 - Tenaya Lake 2015 7.5 Minute Topo Map via pickatrail.com Map 3 - Main Yosemite National Park Map via the National Park Service / npmaps.com Map 4 - Map of California Counties by Population, Count Map 5 - Map of California Counties by Population, Density  For these maps, discuss the following four questions in your breakout groups:\n The scale that they are mapped at - which is the largest scale map? Which is the smallest scale map? How do the ones in between differ? What is the relationship between scale and what you think the intended use of each map might be? What data and \u0026ldquo;layers\u0026rdquo; are needed for each of the maps? For different data, think about whether they are points, lines, or polygons. Which map, Map 4 or Map 5, is properly normalized? What is the effect of normalization?  Exercise 2 - Working with Git and GitHub Since we\u0026rsquo;ll be submitting our work through GitHub this semester, the goal of this exercise is to get comfortable with the GitHub Desktop user interface as well as the Git workflow that we discussed in the first meeting prep video this week.

Like last semester, this means we are starting another semester with what feel like novel questions. Will social distancing requirements be relaxed at any point before May? When will we be able to get vaccinated? What happens if we get sick before we can get a shot? If this is your first semester at SLU, you probably have even more questions about starting at a new institution in the middle of a pandemic.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been reflecting this summer about how novel this all still feels even though we are nearly ten months into this odyssey. I suspect, though, that the Billikens who arrived on campus in the fall of 1918 had similar questions. SLU turned 100 years old that year, and despite the pandemic, we\u0026rsquo;re still around, having just celebrated the completion of our bicentennial. I share this to say - we\u0026rsquo;ll get through this, just like the classes of 1919, 1920, 1921, and 1922 did.\nMy goal for this page is to clarify, at least for the context of my SOC 1120 sections, what this course will be like this semester as we navigate our \u0026ldquo;new normal.\u0026rdquo; I hope doing so reduces some of the ambiguity and stress related to this class and your fall semesters.\nFocusing on What Matters First, though, I think it is important to acknowledge the current situation we are all collectively facing outside of coursework. I assume that all of us are worried about lots of other things, too. You may be wondering if we\u0026rsquo;ll have to leave campus at some point this semester, or if you or your friends or your family will get sick. Millions of Americans, including perhaps you or some of your family members, are struggling financially because of the economic consequences of this virus. Perhaps you are worried about what will happen to them if you are focused on classes? Or how you will focus on classes while also helping them?\nIn March, our lives were dramatically disrupted almost overnight. My wife and I had to worry about what would happen to our daughter if we both got sick. Or if we would see our family, who all live far from Missouri, ever again. Fortunately we did not get sick last spring, and we got to see our families this past summer and fall. Now, however, we have new concerns, like being back in St. Louis away from our families again, and what 2021 will bring with new variants of COVID and vaccination. We should be honest with ourselves - this is an incredibly significant, stressful, and life-altering event we are all collectively experiencing.\nAll of this takes precedence over a semester\u0026rsquo;s worth of college or graduate school classes. I want to make clear that we should not and cannot continue with coursework as if things are \u0026ldquo;normal.\u0026rdquo; We can\u0026rsquo;t ignore the fact that we are living in a moment of uncertainty and crisis. This means we have to be kind to ourselves and each other. It also means all of us, but especially faculty, need drastically re-calibrate our expectations for what we will learn and achieve in courses this semester. This is important because (1) it\u0026rsquo;s just true (2) our mental health will suffer if we don\u0026rsquo;t acknowledge this and try to go on as if everything is normal.\nPractice Self Care The first thing all of you should do is think about what you need to do for yourselves this semester. I exercise a lot - mostly running outdoors when it is nice and cycling indoors when the weather isn\u0026rsquo;t great. I meditate. I have a set daily schedule that I follow even though I\u0026rsquo;m home. I try to make time to read for pleasure. And I write (ok, vent!) about what is going on each day.\nSome of this may be useful to you, and some of it might not be. You need to find what works for you. The fourth part of the Return to Campus Module provides some suggestions for getting encouragement and support. Please return to that for advice, or feel free to talk to me about strategies you can use.\nWhat Class Will Be Like Both of my classes will meet \u0026ldquo;synchronously.\u0026rdquo; This means we have an assigned meeting time, and we\u0026rsquo;ll gather twice a week. Instead of meeting in Morrissey Hall, though, we\u0026rsquo;ll be meeting virtually using a tool called Zoom. Zoom will allow us to get exposed to course content, meet in small groups, and ask questions. It isn\u0026rsquo;t the same, of course, but I am going to do my best to make sure you get as much of the course experience that you would ordinarily receive as I can give you.\nMy decision to teach synchronously was made after reflecting on last spring, taking a class on online teaching, and then teaching synchronously this Fall. My Spring semester students overwhelmingly suggested to me that I teach synchronously, and I take feedback from students seriously.\nDetails about assignments and readings are available in the syllabus, but I wanted to give you all a quick high-level preview of two \u0026ldquo;novel\u0026rdquo; aspects of the course. First, I\u0026rsquo;ll be utilizing a \u0026ldquo;flipped\u0026rdquo; course design, where the lecture portions of the course will happen in-part via videos that you need to watch before you come to class. This will allow us to dedicate our virtual class time to discussing cartography, practicing skills together, and then practicing skills separately. This will also give me time to meet with students individually each week.\nSecond, I\u0026rsquo;m using a project based learning approach to the course. While there are set lab exercises that you will all complete, the homework assignments revolve completely around your final project. I normally give students wide latitude for final project topics. This semester, because we will be entirely remote, I am changing that approach. I am going to strongly encourage you to use one of the two pre-made data sets I will make available. If you feel very strongly about doing something different, and feel like you can take on the extra responsibility for learning a bit more independently, I will have a petition process for choosing a different final project topic.\nGiven the structure of our class meetings, and the independent nature of the homework assignments, being present in class is critical. I therefore expect that you will come to class. The syllabus contains all the details, but you can boil the attendance policy down to this: attending class is important, and I will be keeping track of who comes so I can identify students who might need some additional support. If you can\u0026rsquo;t attend classes occasionally, no worries. Recordings will be made available via Blackboard. That said, there are interactive parts of class that you need to be present for, so please attend as much as you possibly can. For undergraduate students in SOC 4650, remember that missing one class is like missing an entire week\u0026rsquo;s worth of classes for a \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; undergraduate class.\nWhat Happens If I Get Sick? If you become unwell, or find yourself taking care of your family or friends, please let me know as soon as possible! I will not ask for documentation, since if you\u0026rsquo;re sick but not very sick, the last thing most you will want to do is go to a doctor just to get a note. I am proceeding with a spirit of trust in all of you, and ask you reciprocate that with me. If you need to modify assignment due dates, please let me know prior to those deadlines.\nWhat Office Hours Will Be Like My office hours are for you! I don\u0026rsquo;t plan to do other things during this period except chat with students. Please feel free to stop by as often as you would like. It\u0026rsquo;s going to be a little intimidating, of course, dropping in to meet someone virtually who you\u0026rsquo;ve never met in person. But please take the step and come to office hours. Getting to know you all is one of the best parts of my job, and office hours is one of the best ways to do that.\nJust like class, office hours will occur over Zoom as well. There will be two periods:\n 9am-10am (by appointment only) 10am-10:45am (open)  For the appointment only period, you will be able to sign-up for 15 or 30 minute meetings with me via a service called Calendly. Once you sign-up for a slot, you\u0026rsquo;ll get an invitation that includes Zoom meeting information. For the open, drop-in period, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to come to a dedicated Zoom meeting that has a \u0026ldquo;waiting room.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;ll bring one student in from the waiting room as a time so that we can meet privately.\nProvisos This is my plan as of January 25th, 2021. I may modify it further as we progress through the the semester. If I become sick or a member of my family becomes ill, modifications will likely be required. I will do my best to keep everyone updated in a timely fashion. Please check your email and Blackboard regularly. I appreciate everyone\u0026rsquo;s willingness to roll with the many punches we are all facing right now. Remember, we are in this together.\nAcknowledgements Special thanks to Dr. Amy Cooper for sharing her language and policies around COVID-19 modifications, which inspired the original version of this page published in Spring 2020.\n","date":1611529200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611529200,"objectID":"e3929e7811cae4df82f88504a7e7458b","permalink":"https://slu-soc5650.github.io/covid19/","publishdate":"2021-01-25T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/covid19/","section":"","summary":"We\u0026rsquo;re once again facing a semester dramatically altered by our public health situation, though with both more risk (in the form of mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19) and more hope (in the form of vaccines).","tags":null,"title":"COVID-19 Pandemic - Plans for Remote Learning","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"What Are the Main Course Resources?

However, I recommend bookmarking the course website, which includes links to everything.\nHow Is the Course Organized? The course is organized into four parts:\n Course Introduction - an introduction to what GIS is, reading maps, and some of the open science tools and concepts we\u0026rsquo;ll be using this semester Data Cleaning - a pair of meetings focused on preparing and combing \u0026ldquo;tabular\u0026rdquo; data prior to mapping Geoprocessing - an overview of modifying and preparing \u0026ldquo;geometric\u0026rdquo; data to customize maps Map Products with ArcGIS - we\u0026rsquo;ll be focused on ArcGIS Online this semester and specifically will spend time on creating story maps with interactive maps embedded in them Map Products with R - we\u0026rsquo;ll focus on creating similar interactive maps to what ArcGIS Online offers as well as adding finishing details to the static maps we\u0026rsquo;ve been making all semester  All of the course resources, including the syllabus, Blackboard, and this website, are organized around these modules.\nHow Do I Stay Up-to-date? First and foremost, come to class. I start every class with \u0026ldquo;front matter\u0026rdquo; that includes announcements and upcoming deadlines. I also end class with \u0026ldquo;back matter,\u0026rdquo; which reviews some of the most important announcements.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll also use Blackboard\u0026rsquo;s Announcements page to send you emails about class.

Go to the SLU Blackboard login page. You may be prompted to use your username, password, and multi-factor authentication credentials when you login. On the landing page, look for SP2021 SOC-4650-01 \u0026amp; SOC-5650-01.\nGetting Around Blackboard You\u0026rsquo;ll be taken to the Home Page page, and can use the left-hand menu to access different course modules. Within those modules will be content folders with links to course materials, assignment submission portals, quizzes, and discussion boards. There is also a resources section, that includes access to My Grades, where you can get an overview of points you\u0026rsquo;ve earned so far.\nNetiquette Considerations Netiquette is a set of cultural norms (we\u0026rsquo;ll discuss these this semester!) for interacting with classmates online. Different professors might have slightly different ideas about what is appropriate, so don\u0026rsquo;t assume that everything below applies to all classes. These are adapted from Colorado State\u0026rsquo;s guide to online discussions and also include some of SLU\u0026rsquo;s best practices.\n No lurking: This class requires active participation, you can\u0026rsquo;t just follow discussion board conversations. Please participate! Report Glitches: Blackboard is (kind of crappy) software. Sometimes it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work right. If for any reason you experience difficulty participating, please call, email, or otherwise inform me of the issue. Chances are others are having the same problem. Help Others: You may have more experience with online discussion forums than the person next to you. Give them a hand. Show them it’s not so hard. They’re really going to appreciate it! Be Patient: Read everything in the discussion thread before replying. This will help you avoid repeating something someone else has already contributed. Acknowledge the points made with which you agree and suggest alternatives for those with which you don’t. Be Brief: You want to be clear—and to articulate your point—without being preachy or pompous. Be direct. Stay on point. Don’t lose yourself, or your readers, in overly wordy sentences or paragraphs. Write Well: Feel free to be a bit less formal than you would in a paper (contractions are fine), but make sure your work is easy to read. This means correct spelling, grammatical construction and sentence structure are expected. Cite Your Sources: Another big must! If your contribution to the conversation includes the intellectual property (authored material) of others, e.g., books, newspaper, magazine, or journal articles—online or in print—they must be given proper attribution. Use hyperlinks to reference anything online. Emojis: I differ from many of my colleagues here. Use them if you want! Respect Diversity: Respect and be attentive to the diversity of your classmates and instructor. Before communicating, consider your message in the context of the class’ diversity in race, ethnicity, religion, disabilities, gender, sexual orientation, age, social class, marital status, geography, etc. Consider the diversity you can see or know – as well as that you cannot. Remember We Can\u0026rsquo;t See You: Be cautious when using humor or sarcasm; without the context of facial expressions or other body language, your tone or intent could be missed or misunderstood by others. Respect Others' Time: Respect others’ time and life circumstances, which often don’t allow for an immediate response to a question or comment. No Yelling: Step carefully. Beware the electronic footprint you leave behind. Using bold upper-case letters is bad form, like stomping around and yelling at somebody No Flaming: Criticism must be constructive, well-meaning, and well-articulated. Please, no tantrums. Rants directed at any other contributor are simply unacceptable and will not be tolerated. The same goes for profanity. The academic environment expects higher-order language. Remember, You Can\u0026rsquo;t Un-Ring the Bell: Language is your only tool in an online environment. Be mindful. How others perceive you will be largely—as always—up to you. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve hit the send button, you\u0026rsquo;ve rung the bell. Review and Revise: Review your written posts and responses to ensure that you’ve conveyed exactly what you intended. This is an excellent opportunity to practice your proofreading, revision, and rewriting skills—valuable assets in the professional world for which you are now preparing. I try read my posts out loud. This helps me ensure that grammar and sentence structure are correct, your tone is appropriate, and my post is clear.

Zoom is video conferencing software that we\u0026rsquo;ll be using this semester for class meetings and office hours.\nHow Do I Access Zoom? Links to both will be provided through our course Blackboard site. If you have your own Zoom account that is separate from your SLU account, you must use your SLU account. Our Zoom meetings require this. Please make sure you sign-out of your personal Zoom account before trying to access course meetings and office hours. I strongly encourage you to access our class meetings via a laptop or desktop computer. You should download the Zoom Client for Meetings. You may be prompted to use your username, password, and multi-factor authentication credentials, so give yourself time before class or an office hours appointment starts. If you need to access Zoom another way, such as calling in, please let me know.\nHow Do I Login to Zoom In order to facilitate small-group discussions during class, it is important that you are signed into Zoom via SLU. In-order to ensure that you are signed-in correctly, follow the instructions below.\nAccess Zoom via the Web  Go to Zoom\u0026rsquo;s website and make sure you are signed out of any account you have. Go to mySLU Go to Tools and then click-on Zoom  Access Zoom via an App  Open your app and sign-out of any account you have. Choose Sign In with SSO Enter slu for the company domain so that it reads slu.zoom.us You will be taken to mySLU and my need to sign-in using your mySLU username and password  How Do I Use Zoom? Fortunately, using Zoom is pretty straightforward once you\u0026rsquo;ve become used it. There are only a few controls you\u0026rsquo;ll need to know how to use. The most important are how to turn your audio and video on and off. I\u0026rsquo;ll ask you for \u0026ldquo;nonverbal feedback\u0026rdquo; sometimes - these options include raising your hand, saying \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;no\u0026rdquo;, and an option to ask me to slow down.\nThere is also a chat feature we\u0026rsquo;ll be using. When it, though, remember that your course-related communications to the instructor or other students should be considered “professional” (they are not like texts to your friends). Zoom records chats and I can view them, so please keep that in mind as well.\nWhat is the Best Way to Arrange my Zoom Meeting? I strongly recommend that you use Zoom\u0026rsquo;s side-by-side mode for screen sharing. When you are in side-by-side mode, choosing \u0026ldquo;Speaker View\u0026rdquo; will limit the number of webcams you see to just the person speaking. This arrangement allows you to see both my slides and me at the same time, and can be adjusted with your mouse to make the slides smaller or larger.\nDo I Have To Use My Microphone? When you come to class, please mute your microphone. If I call on you and you\u0026rsquo;ve raised your hand, please remember to un-mute yourself before speaking!\nDo I Have To Use My Camera? During lectures, you are not required to have your camera on - it is entirely up to you. I personally appreciate seeing a few students' faces while I teach, so if you want to leave your camera on, you\u0026rsquo;ll be doing me a favor! But like I said, it isn\u0026rsquo;t required for lectures. However, when we use the \u0026ldquo;breakout room\u0026rdquo; feature for small group discussions, you are expected to have your camera on. These discussions will occur regularly during class meetings, so please keep that in mind as you get ready and prepare your work space before class.\nWhat If I Am Having Technical Issues? Feel free to email me at chris.prener@slu.edu. If it is during class, I may not respond right away. That is why we record course meetings, however. If you find that my video or audio is not working well, please let me know in the chat!\nScreen Sharing One of the key ways we\u0026rsquo;ll work together to solve issues you are confronting is with screen sharing. To be prepared to share your screen, please make sure you have a minimal number of windows open, and be conscious of what those windows contain.\nOther Considerations The following are Saint Louis University\u0026rsquo;s best practices for using Zoom:\n Mute your microphone when you are not speaking. Remember to “un-mute” yourself just prior to speaking. Identify yourself when you begin speaking. Expect a few seconds of delay in getting a response from the instructor or another class member to a question; wait before repeating your question or assuming it was not heard. If possible, position your camera such that your video feed does not capture too much of your surroundings or other activity/sound from your home/location. Be conscious of posters, art, or other surroundings that others might find offensive or inappropriate for an educational context. Use the “Raise Hand” and “Chat” (or similar) features of. This limits verbal interruptions and the confusion generated when multiple people try to speak at once. Just as in an on-ground, face-to-face class, limit side conversations, multi-tasking (on your computer or otherwise), and use of your cellphone. Temporarily turn off your video feed and mute your microphone when engaged in any non-class conversation or activity. Respect and be attentive to the diversity of your classmates and instructor. Before communicating, consider your message in the context of the class’ diversity in race, ethnicity, religion, disabilities, gender, sexual orientation, age, social class, marital status, geography, etc. Consider the diversity you can see or know – as well as that you cannot. Remember that video-based class sessions (including chat transcripts) may be recorded and retrieved for later viewing.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\nd.

For some, the math and programming that are the foundation for modern data science techniques come naturally. For others, being introduced to these concepts can be an anxiety producing experience. I am fond the phrase \u0026ldquo;your mileage will vary\u0026rdquo; for describing these differences - no two students have the exact same experience taking a computational methods course. While some of this is specific to this course, the general outlook on approaching data science work that I describe below is hopefully applicable in a far wider arena.\nZen and the Art of Data Analysis One of the biggest challenges with this course can be controlling the anxiety that comes along with learning new skills. R syntax, GIS terms, and Markdown can seem like foreign alphabets at first. Debugging R syntax can be both challenging and a large time suck, in part because you are not yet fluent with this language. Imagine trying to proofread a document written in a language that you only know in a cursory way but where you must find minute inconsistencies like misplaced commas.\nFor this reason, I also think it is worth reminding you that many students in the social sciences struggle with computational methods at first. It is normal to find this challenging and frustrating. I find that students who can recognize when they are beginning to go around in circles are often the most successful at managing the issues that will certainly arise during this course. Recognizing the signs that you are starting to spin your wheels and taking either ten minutes, an hour or two, or a day away from computational coursework is often a much better approach than trying to power through problems.\nData analysis therefore requires a certain mindfulness or what I call \u0026ldquo;habits of mind and habits of method.\u0026rdquo; These mental habits extend past being able to recognize that frustration is setting in. They also include the mental habits needed for Getting and Staying Organized and strategies for Getting Help as you navigate the inevitable errors that come with learning new analytically skills.\nGetting and Staying Organized Doing data science work, and having the space to step away for a day as the last section suggests, requires discipline and organization. Similarly, computational coursework can demanding not just because it is complex but because the courses often have a number of moving pieces that you need to keep track of. Being mindful of this challenge from the beginning, and taking steps to plan for it, is an important part of this course.\nKeeping Track of Where You Are Students who have some system for tracking their work and creating to-do lists are often the most successful in this course, not because they have a fundamentally better grasp on the content but because they simply are more organized. If you have never thought particularly hard about how you manage tasks, now is an excellent time to start doing so. You do not need fancy computer software to accomplish this, though there are an array of possibilities if you do want to use software to keep yourself organized. A legal pad or a notebook can be just as effective as a $50 to-do list manager. The point is, do something!\nI am fond of recommending the Getting Things Done methodology to students as part of thinking more holistically about staying organized. The website Lifehacker posted an excellent introduction to GTD that is a great way to get a sense of how it works and find additional resources for implementing it.\nThe GTD website has a great list of software for those of you looking for a to-do list application. One that isn\u0026rsquo;t listed that I have used for collaborating with my student research team is Trello, a freemium website that allows you to create simple to-do lists. It isn\u0026rsquo;t sophisticated enough for implementing GTD, but it is more than sufficient for managing to-do lists related to this course.\nVirtual Office Hours We don\u0026rsquo;t always do a great job of explaining office hours to students, so I\u0026rsquo;ve put together an explainer on my website to lay out what office hours are for, when you should come, and remind you that it is OK to stop by without an agenda!\nFor the 2020-2021 academic year, there are two types of office hours that I have:\n Appointments: Appoints are available for an hour each week from 9am CST to 10am CST on Wednesdays. You can sign-up for an appointment by visiting my Calendly page. Select either a 15 minute or 30 minute meeting, and fill out your details. Once you submit the meeting request, you\u0026rsquo;ll receive a calendar invitation and a Zoom link. Drop-in: From 10am CST to 10:45am CST on Wednesdays, I\u0026rsquo;ll be available via Zoom for drop-in office hours. No appointment is required, and you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to come to a dedicated Zoom meeting that has a \u0026ldquo;waiting room.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;ll bring one student in from the waiting room as a time so that we can meet privately. The link for this is available on Blackboard.  If these times do not work for your class schedule, please email me to set-up a meeting at another time! I\u0026rsquo;ll work with you to find a time that works for both of our schedules.\nOther Tips In addition to my office hours explainer, I have the following articles on my website:\n \u0026ldquo;Doing the Little Things Right\u0026rdquo; - tips for surviving in this brave new world you\u0026rsquo;ve found yourself in at a university \u0026ldquo;Tips for Writing in the Social Sciences\u0026rdquo; - tips for writing in social science classes  ","date":1543989600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611640800,"objectID":"21b7c52fbf4891bae6e2a8bb34db12ad","permalink":"https://slu-soc5650.github.io/docs/start_coursework/","publishdate":"2018-12-05T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/docs/start_coursework/","section":"docs","summary":"Overview Students have varying experiences learning computational techniques.

All of the applicable sections below should be completed before our first class on February 1st.\nComputer Prep Please work through the following steps:\n  Make sure your operating system is up-to-date. If you are able, I would also recommend upgrading your computer to the most recent release of its operating system that the computer can run.\n On macOS, you can do this through the App Store. The one exception is upgrading to Big Sur. I have not yet done so and, if you have not either, I recommend holding off. I will not be testing out our course materials with Big Sur this semester. Both Windows 7 and Windows 10 have system update tools, though if you have Windows 7, you should consider upgrading to Windows 10.    We\u0026rsquo;ll be sharing computer files throughout the semester, so you should ensure that you have functioning anti-virus software and that it is up-to-date.\n  You\u0026rsquo;ll also need to download files, so you\u0026rsquo;ll need to make sure you have at least twenty gigabytes free if you are not. If you\u0026rsquo;re not sure how to check this, here are some instructions for Windows and macOS.\n Options for de-cluttering include deleting files that are no longer needed, moving files to an external device, moving files to a cloud storage system, or upgrading the internal hard drive (may not be possible for macOS users and some Windows users).    Make sure you know how to access your computer\u0026rsquo;s file management system.\n On macOS, this means being comfortable with Finder.app for finding folders, making new ones, and opening files. Here are some tips for using Finder on recent versions of macOS. On Windows, this means being comfortable with Windows File Explorer for finding folders, making new ones, and opening files. Here are some tips for using File Explorer on Windows 7 or Windows 10.    R Base R You can download R from its website. Choose \u0026ldquo;Download R for (Mac) OS X\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Download R for Windows\u0026rdquo;. Windows users should look for text that says \u0026ldquo;install R for the first time\u0026rdquo; and click the base to the left of that text. Both macOS and Windows users should install R version 4.0.3, known as \u0026ldquo;Bunny-Wunnies Freak Out\u0026rdquo; (R version nicknames come from Peanuts).\nIf you already have R installed, please make sure you have the latest version. You can upgrade it using the same process for a new installation.\nRStudio RStudio is a graphical user interface for R that will make learning the language and using it much, much easier. You should download the free version of RStudio from their website. Choose the appropriate installer for your platform. Make sure R is already installed before installing RStudio.\nIf you already have RStudio installed, please make sure you have the latest version. You can upgrade it using the same process for a new installation.\nR Packages The packages we will need this semester can be downloaded using the following code chunk in RStudio\u0026rsquo;s console:\ninstall.packages(c(\u0026quot;tidyverse\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;here\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;janitor\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;knitr\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;leaflet\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;mapview\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;measurements\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;naniar\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;RColorBrewer\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;remotes\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;rmarkdown\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;sf\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;testDriveR\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;tidycensus\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;tigris\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;tmap\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;viridis\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;webshot\u0026quot;))  You should only have to run this once per computer. If you are not sure where to find the console, don\u0026rsquo;t worry - we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about this on the first day of class!\nPhantomJS PhantomJS is a means for creating \u0026ldquo;headless\u0026rdquo; web-browsers and thus rendering the output of HTML widegts in knitr documents. It makes it possible to get a screengrab of a leaflet map when you \u0026ldquo;knit\u0026rdquo; your .Rmd files, for instance. To install it, use the following code chunk in RStudio\u0026rsquo;s console:\nwebshot::install_phantomjs()  Like installing packages, you should only have to run this once per computer. Again, if you\u0026rsquo;re not sure about using the console, don\u0026rsquo;t worry - we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about this on the first day of class!\nGet Started with GitHub The service that is hosting this website is called GitHub. GitHub is used by programmers, data scientists, and researchers for hosting computer code, data, and project materials (like websites). We will be using GitHub extensively this semester. You will need a free account, which you can sign up for one from GitHub\u0026rsquo;s homepage. If you already have a GitHub account, you do not need a new one.\nOnce you have a GitHub user name, send Chris an email with it so that you can be added to the SOC 4650 \u0026amp; SOC 5650 organization. After you have been added to the organization, you should find your assignments repository and check the Issues tab. There should be an open Issue describing how feedback will be disseminated this semester. Please read it and then close the issue so that we know you\u0026rsquo;ve seen it.\nGitHub Desktop In addition to the applications above, everyone will need a local installation of GitHub Desktop, which is a graphical user interface for accessing Git and GitHub.com. It can be downloaded for free from the application\u0026rsquo;s website. You will need to download and run the installer. Once it is complete, you will need to login to the application with your GitHub.com username and password.\n","date":1543903200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1611640800,"objectID":"2f246f1b9804b4b8f377ce6432f2b146","permalink":"https://slu-soc5650.github.io/docs/start_prep/","publishdate":"2018-12-04T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/docs/start_prep/","section":"docs","summary":"Overview Before you begin the semester, there are a number of things that you should do to help set yourself up for success.

In addition, there are two videos to watch below and a short reading to complete before you submit the first entry ticket.   Meeting Goals This course meeting has an emphasis on the following goals:\n Introduce the basic themes of the course Critique an example web map and the process used to create it Construct simple interactive web maps using leaflet  Before Class Tasks  Complete all course onboarding tasks posted in Module 1 if you have not already done so (see Blackboard) Complete the two videos and the reading listed on the syllabus (see below) Submit Entry Ticket 1 (see Blackboard)  Open Data and GIS in Los Angeles One of the course learning outcomes is titled \u0026ldquo;GISc and Public Policy\u0026rdquo;. Much of the data that we will use this semester is available to us because governmental agencies at the Federal, state, and local levels have published it and made it accessible. We call the movement to make as much data available as possible \u0026ldquo;open data\u0026rdquo;.\nDifferent governments have embraced the open data movement to varying degrees, and the video below discusses Los Angeles' integration of open data and GIS. It is a 9 minute talk given by L.A.\u0026rsquo;s former Chief Data Officer Lilian P. Coral. The talk was part of a conference organized by ESRI, the makers of ArcGIS.\n   Once you\u0026rsquo;ve watched the video, check out the web application featured in the video that visualizes pedestrian and cyclist injuries in Los Angeles. You can also visit L.A.\u0026rsquo;s open data website called GeoHub.\nAnalysis Development Making a produce like L.A.\u0026rsquo;s visualization of pedestrian and cyclist injuries is a complicated effort. Data must be obtained from various sources, modified (a process we call \u0026ldquo;data wrangling\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;data cleaning\u0026rdquo;), and then linked with map coordinates. Once it is ready to be mapped, the web application must be designed and created. We\u0026rsquo;ll call this large-scale process a \u0026ldquo;workflow\u0026rdquo; this semester.\nThe workflow that we\u0026rsquo;ll use is opinionated - there is a strong premise that underlies the workflow about the ways in which spatial data (and data more generally) should be obtained, stored, modified, and mapped. Hilary Parker is a data scientist at Stichfix and also runs a data science podcast called Not So Standard Deviations. She has been speaking recently about an idea called opinionated analysis development. The video linked to below is a 25 minute talk she gave on this idea last year, and she now has a draft paper out on the topic as well. Our workflow for this semester is closely linked to the ideas she discusses in this talk.\nMany (but not all of you) will have experienced some parts of these processes before. Perhaps you\u0026rsquo;ve used Microsoft Excel to organize some information or used SPSS to analyze some quantitative data. We won\u0026rsquo;t be using those tools. Instead, this course will emphasize the use of other tools that support reproducible, accurate, and collaborative data analysis. Throughout the semester, we\u0026rsquo;ll discuss why these tools are important and the advantages they have over other products that are out there. Inspired by Hilary\u0026rsquo;s idea of opinionated analysis development, our goal each week will be to focus on the processes that can be used to increase the reproducibility and accuracy of our geospatial work.\nSome of these processes, like using RMarkdown, are introduced in the introductory \u0026ldquo;chapter\u0026rdquo; (it is quite short!) to Duke University sociologist Kieran Healy\u0026rsquo;s primer The Plain Person\u0026rsquo;s Guide to Plain Text Social Science. This is the one required reading for the entry ticket (though there are several optional ones listed on the syllabus.\n\n Many (but not all of you) will have experienced some parts of these processes before.

This is the one required reading for the entry ticket (though there are several optional ones listed on the syllabus).\nLecture-01 Entry Ticket The entry ticket for the first lecture asks three follow-up questions about these videos and L.A.\u0026rsquo;s interactive website. Please answer these questions and submit them before class on February 1st. Answers must be submitted through Google Forms and each response should be three to four sentences in length. The questions are provided here for reference:\n Briefly describe how the City of Los Angeles uses data and mapping to inform how they deliver city services. After viewing the interactive map showing pedestrian and cyclist injuries, describe what you thought of the map. Some example considerations could include: was it easy to read? to navigate? did you like the colors? was it missing relevant data? In your own words, what are the key aspects of opinionated analysis development? What are some of the advantages of using plain text for data analysis?  The entry ticket also asks for an update on your course onboarding process.\nDuring Class Slides  After Class Tasks  Complete Lab-01 after and come to Meeting 02 prepared to submit it  Lab-01 Please finish Lab-01, which is located in the module-1-intro folder you already download in assignments/lab-01/docs/lab-01.Rmd. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve opened that (use the lab-01.Rproj R project file in assignments/lab-01), you\u0026rsquo;ll need to round-out the narrative text, add code to open the grocery store data (located in assignments/lab-01/data), and make an interactive map of grocery stores in St. Louis City and County using leaflet. All of this can be accomplished using the code we used in class today. A replication file is already present in the assignments folder as well.\nSample Maps In class, I mentioned that I thought some of my favorite maps are the National Park Service\u0026rsquo;s visitor guides for each of there \u0026ldquo;resources\u0026rdquo; (NPS lingo for different parks, monuments, and sites) and James Niehues' legendary ski area maps. The NPS brochures themselves aren\u0026rsquo;t available online, but some of the maps are! Here are some samples:\n James Niehues' map of Big Sky, Montana A collection of Niehues' basemap art without labels, legends, etc Acadia National Park (Maine)  Main Park Map Isle au Haut Detail Map Regional Map   Denali National Park (Alaska)  Main Park Map Park Enterance Detail Map   Yellowstone National Park (Wyoming)  Main Park Map Old Faithful Detail Map Regional Map    All of the National Park Service maps are available via npmaps.com, which catalogs them because different parks make different types of maps available.\n","date":1543903200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612764000,"objectID":"3b0b53da5d114943ccdce133e1237cb0","permalink":"https://slu-soc5650.github.io/docs/meeting_01/","publishdate":"2018-12-04T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/docs/meeting_01/","section":"docs","summary":"Please make sure you have gone through the Course Onboarding section of Blackboard and all of the Getting Started pages of the Course Docs!
