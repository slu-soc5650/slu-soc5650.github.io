## Before Class
### Tasks
Please complete the tasks listed on the [syllabus](https://slu-soc5650.github.io/syllabus/module-4-map-products-with-arcgis.html), and see [Blackboard](https://blackboard.slu.edu) for the entry ticket link. Please make sure you have completed **all** web maps both from the in-class exercises last class and the lab, because you will need them for today's in-class exercises.

## During Class
### Agenda

  1. Exercise 1 - Typography on Maps
  2. Exercise 2 - Creating an ArcGIS StoryMap
  3. *Short Break*
  4. Exercise 3 - Adding Maps to Your StoryMap
  5. Exercise 4 - Changing Typography
  5. *Short Break*
  6. Lab-10 and one-on-one meetings

### Exercise 1 - Sharing Maps
Take a look at [this StoryMap](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/0ae7ea467f5e4701a2968c11d94eb688). As you scroll through it, give some thought to the following points:

  * Think about the characteristics you find appealing about the StoryMap itself. Also notice how *static maps* are employed as opposed *interactive web maps*.
  * How are different fonts used to create a logical hierarchy throughout the StoryMap?
  * Notice the bottom section with sources - I want you to emulate this (with the addition of a [Creative Commons license](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/)) for your final projects!

### Exercise 2 - Creating an ArcGIS StoryMap
For this exercise, we will create a new ArcGIS StoryMap and add some basic text to it to create a logical hierarchy with headings and subheadings.

  1. We'll use the following title - "The Missouri Compromise"
  2. We'll use the following subtitle - "Continuing the Expansion of Chattel Slavery in the United States"
  3. We'll create a section with "Background" as the heading and two subheadings - "The Louisiana Purchase" and "Slavery in the United States." 
      a. For the body text in these sections, we're going to use some filler text for now. Using "Lorem ipsum" as filler text is very common in design, and dates back to the 15th century. We'll use [this lorem ipsum generator](https://loremipsum.io) to create our text.
  5. Then create two other new sections, "Creating Missouri" and "Comparing Changes," and add a paragraph of placeholder text under each as well.
  6. Finally, we'll add some initial information to the Credits footer.

### Exercise 3 - Adding Maps to Your StoryMap
For this exercise, we'll add the three maps we created during class last week to the StoryMap:

  1. We'll start by adding a single web-map using our Louisiana Purchase map from last class in the relevant part of the "Background" section.
  2. Next, under the "Creating Missouri" section, we'll add both of our Missouri Compromise and 1820 Census maps first using the Slideshow format and then using the Sidecar format.
  3. Finally, we'll use our Louisiana Purchase and Missouri Compromise reference maps to illustrate how the slider functionality works. This will be inserted in the "Comparing Changes" section.
  
### Exercise 4 - Changing Typography
For this exercise, we'll create a custom theme that changes the default font families used for headings and body text. We'll create a new theme, modify these elements, and publishing this theme before adding it to our StoryMap. We'll call this "Custom Test Theme for " and then include our individual names in the theme title. Under typography, we'll change the title and headings to Veranda Pro and the paragraph text to Pax. Once we have saved our changes and published the theme, we'll also cover how to go back and modify the theme in addition to applying it to our StoryMap.

## After Class
### Lab-10
The Lab-10 instructions are available in `module-4-storymap-1` or can viewed online [here](https://github.com/slu-soc5650/module-4-storymap-1/blob/master/assignments/lab-10.pdf). This exercise picks up where we have left-off with the in-class exercise, adding the two maps from Lab-09 to your StoryMap using either the Slideshow or Sidecar approach.

### Lab-10 Replication Materials
[A replication StoryMap is available here](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/f6be7a7d6dbe44daabcf4da7e8be48ad).

## Meeting Reminders
Please don't forget about what is due for next week, which is listed on the [syllabus](https://slu-soc5650.github.io/syllabus/module-4-map-products-with-arcgis.html). In addition to Lab-10, there are also some upcoming deadlines in April I want to remind you of: 

  * students in SOC 5650 will have a draft paper due **next Monday** (April 12th) - instructions have been added to the [final project document](https://slu-soc5650.github.io/final-project/research-note.html)
  * all students will have a draft ArcGIS story map due April 26th - instructions have been added to the [final project document](https://slu-soc5650.github.io/final-project/arcgis-storymap.html)

<br>

## Course Trajectory
Now that we have covered getting an ArcGIS StoryMap designed, you can start to work on this facet of your final project!
