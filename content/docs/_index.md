The course docs are designed to provide a single place for accessing resources related to either the course as a whole or to specific lectures. If you find an error or omission, or have a suggestion, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/slu-soc5650/slu-soc5650.github.io/issues) and let me know the details. I want to make sure this is as user-friendly and informative as possible!

## Getting Started
These pages are primarily designed to help you get ready to take SOC 4650 or SOC 5650. Their material needs to be completed *before* the beginning of the semester. The [Course Software](/docs/course-software) page also can be used if you decide to set-up the course software on your own computer midway through the semester or have to set-up a new computer.
