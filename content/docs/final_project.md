## Overview

As we go through the semester, I'll be using this section to add some additional information about the final project. For now, you can find the deadlines associated with the project on [our syllabus](https://slu-soc5650.github.io/syllabus/assignments.html) and steps for the initial vignettes in the [final project instructions](http://slu-soc5650.github.io/final-project/).
