This class introduces both the theoretical and technical skills that constitute the nascent field of geospatial data science. Techniques introduced include map production and cartography, spatial data cleaning and management, and the manipulation of both tabular and spatial data. The course incorporates a wide variety of social, economic, health, urban, meteorological, and environmental data. These data are mapped at a variety of extents, from the City of St. Louis to the St. Louis Metropolian region, Missouri, and the entire United States.

To map these data, we balance an introduction to the industry-standard proprietary ecosystem, ArcGIS, with cutting-edge techniques for working with spatial data in the programming language `R`. Data science tools, including Markdown, Git, and GitHub are also introduced.
