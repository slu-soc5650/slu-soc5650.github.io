This course has five intertwined objectives. After completing the course, students will be able to:

1.  *Geographic information science*: Describe the concepts that form the foundation of GISc work.
2.  *Data management*: Perform basic data cleaning and geoprocessing tasks using `R`.
3.  *Data visualization*: Create and present visualizations of spatial data using `R` and ArcGIS Online.
4.  *Analysis development*: Apply techniques that make GISc work more reproducible, accurate, and collaborative using GitHub, `R`, Markdown, and other tools.
5.  *Research synthesis*: Plan and implement a spatial data analysis project that utilizes the techniques described throughout the course.
